# Ludum-Dare-42

This is our game for the Ludum Dare 42: Tower of fated shoulders destined for survival from the Pouch destroyer rainbow road of doom with leeches


The theme was "Running out of space"


So you have to run to avoid being eatten by the "end of space" while saving others survivors, but you can't save everyone.


You can control your character with the arrows or WASD and throw people away with the numeric keyboard.

You can also reset the game with 'R' or 'F5'.
